# Backend

Minimal README created so `pyproject.toml` can reference `README.md` during packaging/installation.

Project: backend
Author: Alejandro Patiño García <alexpatino92@yahoo.com>

Notes:

- If you don't want the project installed with Poetry, run `poetry install --no-root`.
- To change metadata style, consider converting to `[tool.poetry]` or removing `readme` from `pyproject.toml`.
